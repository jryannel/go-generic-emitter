# Generic Event Emitter in Go

An event emitter allows you to register listeners for events and emit events. This is a generic implementation of an event emitter in Go as part of my learning. This is not meant to be a library, but rather a learning exercise.

Material for this project was taken from the following sources:

* https://mionskowski.pl/posts/generic-event-dispatcher-in-go/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/qaziao/my_generic_event_listener_emitter/
* https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics
* https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/the-nodejs-event-emitter/



## Usage

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```


## Example

See the [cmd/main.go](cmd/main.go) file for an example of how to use the event emitter.
